Embedded System Project For Under Water Exploration 

# Objective
The team has been given four base objectives, each is fairly complex and comes with its own list of more specific requirements. They will require time and understanding to complete them, however, the base objectives are straightforward. For the first objective, the team is tasked with designing a power distribution board that can supply power to every component on the craft. This includes powering the BlueRobotics Electronic Speed Controller and its associated BlueRobotics Thruster, the PixHawk, the Raspberry Pi and the Trac Deckhand 40 Winch. These components have varying power requirements meaning that the team will need to use circuitry that can distribute and manage power to each device correctly.

The second objective the team is faced with is communication between all devices. There are several lines of communication that need to be established based upon the requirements from the sponsor. Communication between the host computer and the PixHawk Controller, between the PixHawk and the Raspberry Pi, between the Raspberry Pi and the winch, the depth sensor, and the underwater technology that the Smart Microsystems Lab will eventually implement. This objective will be mostly handled on the programming side, however, it has a few electrical needs that must be addressed.

Moving on to the third objective, the controller. This is the link between the communication and the power. The controller will control things like the coordinates of the watercraftâ€™s destination and the routing of power to operate the crafts thruster or winch. The controller will be responsible for a very important portion of the project and that is component and circuit protection. Due to the restrictions that come with using batteries, the team cannot exceed the maximum current capabilities of the battery without having unstable and potentially fatal implications. The controller will be responsible for operating a relay that will route current to one of the two very demanding components on the boat.

Finally, the fourth objective is a more simple objective. The team is asked to replace the rope that comes standard on the Trac Deckhand 40 Winch with a data cable that is capable of meeting the communication requirements as well as being strong enough to support its own weight as well as the sensors weight.
